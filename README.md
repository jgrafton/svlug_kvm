getting started with qemu & kvm on centos7
==========================================




### introduction
"KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) is a Linux kernel module that allows a user space program to utilize the hardware virtualization features of various processors.  Today, it supports recent Intel and AMD processors (x86 and x86_64), PPC 440, PPC 970, S/390, ARM (Cortex A15), and MIPS32 processors.

QEMU can make use of KVM when running a target architecture that is the same as the host architecture. For instance, when running qemu-system-x86 on an x86 compatible processor, you can take advantage of the KVM acceleration - giving you benefit for your host and your guest system." - from wiki.qemu.org

for server distro's.
